# 📊 Power BI Project: Internet Sales Dashboard (AdventureWorks)

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Sales teams at a retail organization needed to move from static Excel reports to interactive dashboards. The goal was to better track internet sales by product, customer, and time, and to compare performance against budgets. Different users (Sales Manager and Sales Reps) needed custom views to help with decision-making and follow-ups.

## ⚙️ What I Did
- Developed a responsive Power BI dashboard tailored to both Sales Managers and Sales Representatives.
- Used the AdventureWorks sample database connected via Microsoft SQL Server.
- Incorporated Excel-based 2021 budget data for performance comparison.
- Enabled role-based filtering (by customer and product).
- Built KPIs and time-series visuals for tracking historical performance.
- Ensured the dashboard supports scheduled data refreshes.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Power BI (DAX, data modeling, slicers, and visuals)
- Microsoft SQL Server (AdventureWorks Database)

## 🔑 Key Features
- Customer and product-level sales insights with interactive filters
